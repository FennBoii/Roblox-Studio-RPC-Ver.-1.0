- Roblox-Studio-RPC-Ver.-1.0
    - This plugin works on all devices that use node.js
    - These include, MacOS and WindowsOS. This can potentially work on
      linux but it soley depends if you can get roblox studio on linux
      and get the plugin installed.

- The Main Requirements
    - Node.js, can be installed here: https://nodejs.org/
    - Discord, can be installed here: https://discord.com/
